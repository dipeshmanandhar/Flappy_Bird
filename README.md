# Flappy_Bird
An application of Genetic Algorithms and Machine Learning on the classic Flappy Bird game

## Description
This application attepts to design an AI for playing the classic _Flappy Bird_ game by building a Neural Network from a Genetic Algorithm. For each generation of birds, many slightly variant birds are produced from the previous generation's highest scoring bird, as shown below:

After the generation runs for a while, only a few of the birds remain, as shown below:
